# Hardware and Software: July 2020
At the beginning of the Covid-19 period I knew that I’d be spending a lot more time indoors than usual, so I spent some time trying to create my dream setup. I’m pretty happy with it all at the moment, here’s what it looks like:

I’ve still been spending a lot of time on site at my Web Dev position, so I haven’t been able to enjoy it as much as I thought I would be!

Here’s what I’m running at the moment: 

### Hardware 
#### 13” MacBook Pro 2015 16GB Memory 128GB Storage 

Great laptop, loving the retina display. Great keyboard before Apple changed the design. Storage is awful but I got a good deal on the laptop so I’m happy.

I was running an i5 4690k 1050ti desktop for gaming previously, but I sold it and put some money towards the MBP around May earlier this year. I sold the desktop because I wanted to focus more on development and personal growth, and it’s been going really well so far!

#### Seagate Backup Plus Slim 2TB
Need this for storage thanks to the 128GB internal SSD.

#### OPPO R17 - Android 10 - 6GB RAM - 128GB
Perfect Android phone for daily use, although I still haven’t been game enough to sign up for a MyOPPO account.

#### Logitech M585 Mouse
This was the cheapest bluetooth mouse at the JB Hi-Fi closest to my house. It takes some getting used to, I’ve had some problems with the Logi Options software. 
I use the Logitech Anywhere 2S at my workplace, and the Anywhere 2S doesn’t have a middle click, which I think didn’t feature heavily on the box or I would’ve picked up something else for sure. Middle click swaps the mouse wheel from normal scroll to free scroll. Still better than the M585.

#### Axiom m32 MIDI Keyboard
My first MIDI keyboard. Still learning Pro Tools. And will probably be in the learning stage for a while. I don’t mind, it’s a calming activity for me, similar to gardening. 

#### Kindle Wifi 6”
Just got this recently and I’m reading [10% Happier by Dan Harris](https://www.amazon.com.au/10-Happier-Self-Help-Actually-Works/dp/0062265431). Also reading Dune and Norwegian Wood but much more slowly (been going a while).  This is my third Kindle model, I’ve picked up a case for it this time. I definitely read a lot more with a Kindle than without one.

### Software

#### Sublime Text
Cannot operate on a computer with Sublime Text, it has changed my workflow so much. Mostly used feature is editing multiple lines at one and being able to search with regex. Notes generally start here, and if I need to refer to it later, it gets moved to Evernote.

#### Evernote
My Life. Everything I do is in here, from Grocery lists to my template for a good day plan. Becoming a database of my life.

#### Android Studio
Need this for my Android Dev. Don’t think I’ll be finding a good alternative to this for a while.

#### LastPass
Great Password manager. Jumped in after getting used to iOS password autofill and moving back to Android. Swapped all my passwords to very strong ones, now I only have to remember one password. Been telling everyone in my life to use this.

#### Todoist
Been using Todoist less and less recently as I’ve gotten busier and better at organising. When I wasn’t working full time, every activity I did would be tracked in Todoist.

#### Day One
I don’t journal every single day but I’ve been trying to do it with some consistency. NOTE: Day One doesn’t sync entries between their Android and MacOS applications, even if you have premium.
